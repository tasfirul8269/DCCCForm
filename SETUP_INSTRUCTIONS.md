## 4. Troubleshooting

### Images not uploading to Cloudinary
- Verify the upload preset name is exactly `photography_contest`
- Make sure the preset is set to **Unsigned** mode
- Check browser console for errors

### Data not appearing in Google Sheets
- Verify the Apps Script deployment URL is correct
- Check that the script is deployed as "Anyone" can access
- Check Google Apps Script logs: In Apps Script editor, click **Executions** to see any errors

### CORS Errors
- This is expected with Google Apps Script (mode: 'no-cors')
- The data will still be submitted successfully even if you see CORS errors in console
